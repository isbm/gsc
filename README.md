# gsc: Git to OSC Wrapper

An attempt to bring OBS and Git together without rewriting Source Server part in OBS.

## General Usage

The idea is based that the `.osc` and `.git` resides in the same place. Everthing
that is in the package directory is also going to Git. But `.git` is not going to
the package.
